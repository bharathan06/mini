TASK:
Based on the information above and the repsonse mode (analysis or risk analysis or planning), create a comprehensive startup roadmap divided into these five phases:

  1. *Discover & Define*  
     - Identify and articulate the core problem.  
     - Validate problem relevance and urgency.  
     - Define the unique value proposition.

  2. *Plan & Prototype*  
     - Conduct market research and competitor analysis.  
     - Outline features, MVP scope, and technical requirements.  
     - Develop a low-fidelity prototype or wireframe.

  3. *Build & Validate*  
     - Assemble a minimal team and tech stack.  
     - Build the MVP.  
     - Run usability tests and gather feedback.  
     - Iterate and refine the product.

  4. *Launch & Acquire*  
     - Prepare legal, financial, and registration steps (e.g., company incorporation, domain purchase).  
     - Develop go-to-market strategy and marketing channels.  
     - Plan customer acquisition and early traction tactics.

  5. *Scale & Sustain*  
     - Optimize operations and key metrics (e.g., CAC, LTV).  
     - Secure funding or partnerships.  
     - Expand product features and enter new markets.  
     - Establish support, analytics, and growth processes.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Use clear headings for each phase (e.g., “### Phase 1: Discover & Define”).
- Under each heading, list 4–6 actionable bullet points.
- Write in a friendly, beginner-oriented tone—assume no prior startup experience.
- Where relevant, include “Tips” or “Examples” in italics for extra guidance.
- Do not exceed 300 words total.

Now, wait for the user input, ask the user for any missing information and generate the startup roadmap.
